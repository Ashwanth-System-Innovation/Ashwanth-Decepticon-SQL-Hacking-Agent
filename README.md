## üí° What is **Vibe Hacking** ?

**Ashwanth Decepticon - SQL Hacking Agent** is a new paradigm in Offensive Security defined by PurpleAILAB.  

Unlike traditional red teaming methods that rely on manual execution, **AI agents autonomously perform red teaming tasks** in Vibe Hacking.

> ### *The Best Defense is a Good Offense.*

## üí° Why **Ashwanth Decepticon - SQL Hacking Agent**?

As agents become more sophisticated, attackers evolve accordingly.  
From AI-driven phishing to self-learning malware, offensive techniques are becoming increasingly automated and intelligent.

To effectively defend against AI-powered threats, **we must act faster**‚Äîand **we must act first**.  
**Decepticon** is designed for that very purpose: using AI agents to automate red teaming **before attackers automate theirs.**

Built on the robust foundation of **LangChain/LangGraph**, Decepticon grows alongside the thriving AI agent ecosystem. By leveraging the same cutting-edge frameworks that power the future of AI, we ensure compatibility, scalability, and continuous innovation through community collaboration.

Delegate repetitive and manual tasks to agents, and focus on intuition and decision-making to fulfill the true essence of a **CyberSecurity Supervisor**.

## MCP Support

This project supports loading tools via the [LangGraph MCP Adapter](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-mcp-adapters).

You can define your MCP tools in a configuration file called `mcp_config.json`.  
Tools are grouped by **agent names**, and each agent can have multiple MCP servers.

### Supported MCP Transports

- `stdio` - Standard input/output communication
- `streamable_http` - HTTP-based streaming communication

### `mcp_config.json` Structure

```json
{
  "agent_name": {
    "mcp_server_1": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["./path/to/script.py"],
      "transport": "stdio"
    },
    "another_mcp_server_streamable_HTTP": {
      "url": "mcp-url"
    }
  }
}
```

### Example

```json
{
  "reconnaissance": {
    "reconnaissance": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["./src/tools/mcp/Reconnaissance.py"],
      "transport": "stdio"
    },
    "desktop_commander": {
      "url": "https://server.smithery.ai/@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander/mcp?api_key=your-api-key"
    }
  },
  "initial_access": {
    "initial_access": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["./src/tools/mcp/Initial_Access.py"],
      "transport": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

**To add a new MCP tool:**
1. Create your MCP tool script under `src/tools/mcp/`
2. Add the corresponding entry in `mcp_config.json`
3. Restart the application to load the new tool
